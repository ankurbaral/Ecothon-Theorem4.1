The project's culmination aligned with pinpointing a suitable landfill site, a task undertaken in collaboration with the "Ecothon" Hackathon initiative. The process involved integrating AI utilizing OSM and GIS.
Initially, leveraging OSM, suitable land parcels situated away from water bodies and buildings, while close to roads, were identified.
Subsequently, utilizing GIS, these identified parcels underwent further refinement based on criteria such as slope and soil quality control.
