The project's culmination aligned with pinpointing a suitable landfill site, a task undertaken in collaboration with the "Ecothon" Hackathon initiative. The process involved integrating AI utilizing (OpenStreetMap)OOSM and (Google Earth Engine)GEE.
Initially, leveraging OSM, suitable land parcels situated away from buildings, while close to roads, were identified.
Subsequently, the obtained coordinate from the OSM model was used in GEE to check wether any water body lied near the given point. It was done so by creating a buffer having an area of 9097sq. meter which computed if any water body fell inside of the buffer.
